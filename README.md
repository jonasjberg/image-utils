`convert-keep-metadata.py`
--------------------------
Converts images from one format to another while keeping any metadata.

```
Usage:  convert-keep-metadata.sh [TARGET_EXTENSION] [FILES..]

Converts images from one format to another while keeping any metadata.
Given [FILES] are converted the format specified by [TARGET_EXTENSION]

After converting the image, metadata from the original is applied to
the target image. The destination image metadata may contain
duplicates, but metadata is not likely lost in the conversion.
Tranferring the original metadata in an exact form is probably a
non-trivial task..

    [TARGET_EXTENSION]
        See "convert -list format" for valid extensions.

    [FILES..]
        Path(s) to the images to convert.

`detect-bad-images.sh`
----------------------
Finds corrupt images by using external tools `exiftool` and `jpeginfo`.

Detects corrupt images from reading contents and metadata.
Good for sifting through data produced by data recovery or forensics.
Does rudimentary argument checking, but there are bound to be bugs.  Reads file
type from the "magic" header bytes, so file extension should not matter.

### Example usage:

* **Looping over results**  

    Generic usage template. Note that you should probably research handling
    "weird" file names properly, like those containing spaces, etc.

    ```bash
    ~/Bin/detect-bad-images.sh -b ~/Pictures/* | while IFS='\n' read -r f
    do
        [ -f "$f" ] || continue
        printf "do whatever with %s ..\n" "$f"
    done
    ```

* **Remove bad images**  

    Deletes images deemed "bad". There is no undoing deletion so be careful!

    ```bash
    find ~/Pictures -type f -exec ~/Bin/detect-bad-images.sh -d '{}' \;
    ```

### Complete usage information
To display usage information, run:
```bash
~/Bin/detect-bad-images.sh -h
```
Probably won't be complete though.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`auto-adjust-photos.sh`
-----------------------
Auto-adjusts images based on metadata, file size and image dimensions.

Originally written for automatically modifying images uploaded to the 'Camera
Uploads' Dropbox folder. For instance, all images shot by a certain
camera/device might need to be resized or have the white balance auto-adjusted
**if** the image size is above a set threshold.

### Complete usage information
To display usage information, run:
```bash
~/Bin/auto-adjust-photos.sh -h
```
Probably not complete.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`interactive-video-rotation-renamer.py`
---------------------------------------
Preview videos and interactively rename them to indicate what should be done by
other tools.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`chrome-screencapture-renamer.sh`
---------------------------------
Renames images created by the "Full Page Screen Capture" Chrome plugin.

    ```

2. Running the script:

    ```bash
    [jonas:~/today] $ ~/dev/projects/image-utils/chrome-screencapture-renamer.sh ~/today
    ```

3. Resulting file names:

    ```bash
    [jonas:~/today] $ ls -1
    2016-11-22T171900 carlosbecker-posts-jekyll-with-sass -- screenshot.png
